# A/B Testing – Data Analysis Internship Project

This project simulates an A/B test using Python to compare the conversion rates of two webpage variants (A and B).

## 📌 Objective
To determine if the new webpage version (Variant B) performs significantly better than the current version (Variant A).

## 🔍 Key Steps:
- Simulated data for 10,000 users per variant
- Calculated conversion rates and 95% confidence intervals
- Visualized results with error bars
- Performed hypothesis testing using z-test

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels
- SciPy

## 📂 Files Included
- `2_Statistics_A_B.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full simulation and analysis
- `AB_Testing_Presentation.pptx`: Final project presentation

## ✨ Outcome
Variant B showed a statistically significant improvement in conversion rate, backed by a p-value < 0.05.
